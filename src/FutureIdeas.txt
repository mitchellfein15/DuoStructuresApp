More short term:
- Day streak
- Add more lessons for each section
- animations for correct and incorrect answers
    - sound effect for correct/incorrect
- merge practice and lessons tab

More long term:
- Visualization for algorithms
- interactive diagram for data structures
- code snippet questions/ code completion questions
- "order the steps" questions for algorithms
- implement email?
- common mistakes/ previous mistakes stored in data base per user
- maybe make and add video explainations
- improve overall animations
